RevealCrypticMailJavaScript
===========================

A small bit of JavaScript which allows an email address to be obfuscated until it is being initiated with JavaScript execution, hindering robots from scanning it for spam.
It turns something like "lin_liam&amp;on" in to "no@mail.nil", so the JavaScript/Html code has the email address only in an obfuscated form.
Works in Wordpress.
